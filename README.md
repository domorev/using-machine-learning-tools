# Using Machine Learning Tools

## Building software that uses pre-existing toolkits (Keras and TensorFlow) to solve a variety of machine-learning problems.

In this project, I experimented with convolutional neural networks (CNN) classifiers using an MNIST-like dataset based on Americal Sign Language.

The dataset contained images of hands in poses corresponding to letters in American Sign Language. 

I built several different networks, fit them to data, optimised some of the hyper-parameters and evaluated the results obtained by these classifiers. These are the same processes that a data scientist would go through in practice whenever they use deep learning to solve a particular problem.
